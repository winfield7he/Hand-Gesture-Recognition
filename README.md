# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
This is a design project proposed and conducted by Wenfei He, who is doing a Master of Electrical and Electronic Engineering.
The program includes two parts so far, which are Automatic Hand Tracking and Feature Extraction, the hand recogition part using ANN or other machine learning techniques will be implemented in future. 

The first part regarding Automatic Hand Tracking:

This part is modified on the basis of a framework given by Chanseok Kang and Sanchul Kim
This program of hand extraction is based and modified on the previous work published on the internet, the framework has been provided by Chanseok Kang and Sanchul Kim
The source of the original code is: https://github.com/goodboychan/handGesture

The current framework is modified by implemented a novel approach to segment hand directly from its shadow and background as a mask, which is going to be utilized in the second part of this project

The second part regarding Feature Extraction: 

This part is proposed to address the hand feature extraction, part of which like codes involving curvature and distance feature extraction are given by Rishabh_Sharma, who is currently doing his PHD in RMIT.

In this part, some innovative algorithms have also been implemented including hand palm direction determination and the relative axis system establishment. 

In addition, with the purpose of improving the system robust, anther hand segmentation algorithm has been given in this part. Although the results of test shows it seems does not actually improve the overall performance, it provides a simple but working solution for hand segmentation algorithm.

Detected Issues:

I have to admit that with the progress of this project, some issues exists in the current codes, which would be solved in future work.
